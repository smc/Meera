Meera Font
==========

Meera font is a Malayalam font designed by Hussain K H and maintained by Swathanthra Malayalam Computing project. 
This is a comprehensive Malayalam font with 1000+ glyphs for all common Malayalam ligatures.

It has carefully designed ascent, descent metrics optimized for Malayalam script's vertically stacked conjuncts.
Meera is even stroke typeface for better screen rendering, with individually designed glyphs for complex conjuncts rather than
using component glyphs. The opentype rules used in this font later became a reference for many other Malayalam fonts.

Released in 2007, Meera is default Malayalam font for many GNU/Linux distros for Malayalam script. The font is widely used in
web as the primary choice for Malayalam screen font. In 2016 Latin glyphs were added. The font is available only in regular style.
